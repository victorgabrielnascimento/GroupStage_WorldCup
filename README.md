### Hello Dev

<br>

## Welcome to my 2k22 World Cup group stage project! I used the Python language to carry out this project, the project is run by the terminal in menu format with some interactions, as in the main menu where we have the options:
[start game] goes straight to the simulation of the games that result in a game table, where it shows the results of all the games played by the selections and finally the points table, where the points, wins, draws, defeats and goal balance of each selection and the same printa which were the two classified selections!

<br>
<p>This projeto is a group stage simulator that runs in the terminal in menu format, with basic interactive options, such as [start game] which will start the simulation. [rules] that explains to football laypeople how the points system works, classifications, etc... [Know the selections] where it shows the lineups of all the selections present in the group stage, finally [Exit] which only closes the terminal.
